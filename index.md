**<mark>This site is currently in development, but you are free to look around.</mark>**

Hello there, I'm 両津 and welcome to my site/project/hobby/thing. I'm not sure how you found me, but I'm glad you're here. 

The goal of this site is to help you (yes, YOU!) transition to reading Japanese in the way you are reading this page (i.e. without looking every other word up). That means reading books, manga, newspapers, etc. created by Japanese native speakers for Japanese native speakers ***as if*** you were a native speaker as well. If that has been a goal of yours—as it has been for me—then you've come to the right place.

The way that I'll help you reach your goal is rather simple: I'll get you reading native content right away. Sorry, but there's no way to get to reading native content without actually ***reading native content***. To help you retain the vocabulary you learn along the way I'll be providing you some custom spaced repetition software that integrates with the reading I'll be sending you.

When this site is completed, you'll be able to find out how to use the website (Philosophy)
