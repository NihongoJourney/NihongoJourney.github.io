**My Nihongo Journey**

I created this site in Decemeber 2021 to create support and tools to help *me* on *my* journey from intermediate to advanced Japanese language fluency. Yes, it's true‚ÄîI made this website to help myself. Selfish as that may seem, that's good news for you. I'm user numero uno, and because I'll be using this tool every day, you can be sure that I will be dedicated to making sure the site is working well. 

On the other hand, you might be questioning why you should even keep reading. Who is this ‰∏°Ê¥•, and why should I trust this chump who hasn't even verified that his method works? Well, don't take it from me. I'm just following in the footsteps of others. Mostly. üò¨ 

After spending ***years*** (it's been a full decade ü§´) experimenting with different language learning programs, I hit upon a pretty effective [method](_philosophy/#) a few years back for improving language skills that works even for the resource-constrained learner. I call this method Immersive Repetition&trade; (fancy, no?). At its core the method is **just** reading native Japanese content while accumulating/reviewing vocabulary with [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} each day. 

**Note:** For those of you in the know, my method is just an application of Khatzumoto's 10,000 sentence [approach](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/10000-sentences-how/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}; for those of you not familiar with Khatzumoto's [AJATT](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com/blog/all-japanese-all-the-time-ajatt-how-to-learn-japanese-on-your-own-having-fun-and-to-fluency/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} (All Japanese All The Time) method, a good one-minute summary explained by [Matt vs Japan](https://twitter.com/mattvsjapan){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} is found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EW_1jmE2as&ab_channel=FingtamLanguages&t=2m5s){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

**Also Note:** For the [Refold/MIA](https://refold.la/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} community, this method is a hack for getting through the slog of [Stage 2](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-2/overview){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

**Why Nihongo Journey**

Despite my excitement in finding an effective way to build Japanese language skills, I've also found that the tools and advice available today are a little wanting. Despite the immense amount of support avaiable for learning Japanese at an introductory level, it's pretty darn hard to find any decent path to get from a level of moderate proficiency to native fluency. It's all well and good to say "Immerse Yourself" and "Use Anki," but where's the easy button? Don't get me wrong: I'm grateful for the advice and support I've found online. But is it too much to ask to be spoonfed the things I need to do? How's a guy supposed to reach native fluency without living in Japan or without significant time and/or money to can dedicate to hobbies?



I've been frustrated by the amount of time I spend learning
Effective as this method is, it has its issues. First is the considerable friction in actually reading native content. Who has time to find intersting and free content (sorry, newspaper articles) and get it in front of them each day? Second is the pain of looking up new words. Have you ever had to flip through a ËæûÊõ∏ to look up a word? Yuck. Talk about a surefire way to lose the will to learn. Even today with copy, paste, and Google Translate, there is still considerable friction. The final issue is Anki itself, and this is the big one. Anki may be the most powerful way to brute force acquire vocabulary, but how do you even use the app? Using the app is not intuitive, the manual is long, and honestly how does anyone know what are the right amount of cards to learn/review each day? Moreover, creating new cards based off the content you are reading is a painstaking, manual process. Sure, there are pre-made decks out there, but that will only get you so far. And finally, there's the üêò in the room: the UI. Most people expect apps to look and feel polished. Anki looks like its from 90s, and would-be users often assume it lacks quality because of its appearance.

In short, considerable friction in three factors‚Äîcontent, translation, and reviews‚Äîlimits the usefulness of Immersive Repetition. What better way to do that than learn computer science, create a blog, and support an entire ecosystem of similarly situated Japanese language learning enthusiasts? Ok, perhaps I do have a siginficant amount of time to dedicate on hobbies...

So if I found a method that works, why did I build this site instead of just going about my business on my own? Rage . W  out of perhaps you know my frustration?

**Who is this site for?**

As you might have gathered from above, this site is NOT dedicated to beginners. Sorry, I'm just not that interested in helping beginners learn the ropes of Japanese, and honestly you should thank me for it. I'm not a patient teacher and there are a lot of better and FREE resources out there. Don't be coming around the Nihongo Journey twitter page asking me for support to learn „Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™ or „Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä. I'll just point you to Duolingo. Looking to learn some basic Êº¢Â≠ó? Go check out Wanikani. Need to learn the basics of grammar? Tae Kim's got you [covered](http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

But who are you going to call on the journey to learn 6000 vocabulary words? Or to obtain the mythical 10,000 sentences?
