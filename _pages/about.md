**My Nihongo Journey?**

I created this site in Decemeber 2021 to create support and tools to help me on my journey from intermediate to advanced language fluency.  Despite the immense amount of support avaiable for learning Japanese at an introductory level, I've found it hard to find any decent path to get from a level of moderate proficiency to what I would considered native fluency. Honestly, is there anyone you know who has reached native fluency without living in Japan or without significant time or money they can dedicate on hobbies? 

After spending ***years*** (its been a full decade 🤫) experimenting with what works and what doesn't work for me, I ran into a new issue: getting the material I needed in a convenient (read: free) way. What better way to do that than learn computer science, create a blog, and support an entire ecosystem of similar minded Japanese language enthusiasts? Ok, perhaps I do have a siginficant amount of time to dedicate on hobbies...

**Who is this site for?**

As you might have gathered from above, this site is NOT dedicated to beginners. Sorry, I'm just not that interested in helping beginners learn the ropes of Japanese, and honestly you should thank me for it. I'm not a patient teacher and there are a lot of better and FREE resources out there. Don't be coming around the Nihongo Journey twitter page asking me for support to learn ひらがな or カタカナ. I'll just point you to Duolingo. Looking to learn some basic 漢字? Go check out Wanikani. Need to learn the basics of grammar? Tae Kim's got you [covered](http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

But who are you going to call on the journey to learn 6000 vocabulary words? Or to obtain the mythical 10,000 sentences?
