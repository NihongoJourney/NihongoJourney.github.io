**My Nihongo Journey**

I created this site in Decemeber 2021 to create support and tools to help *me* on *my* journey from intermediate to advanced Japanese language fluency. Yes, it's true‚ÄîI made this website to help myself. Selfish as that may seem, that's good news for you. I'm user number 1, and because I'll be using this tool every day, you can be sure that I will be dedicated to making sure the site is working well. 

On the other hand, you might be questioning why you should even keep reading. Who is this ‰∏°Ê¥•, and why should I trust this chump who hasn't even verified that his method works? Well, you're going to have to trust me on that one üò¨. 

Getting back to the point of this section,\*ahem\*, perhaps you know my frustration? Despite the immense amount of support avaiable for learning Japanese at an introductory level, it's pretty darn hard to find any decent path to get from a level of moderate proficiency to native fluency. Honestly, is there anyone you know who has reached native fluency without living in Japan or without significant time or money they could dedicate to hobbies?

After spending ***years*** (it's been a full decade ü§´) experimenting with different language learning programs, I hit upon a pretty effective [method](_philosophy/#) for improving language skills that works even for the resource-constrained learner. I call this method Immersive Repetition&trade; (fancy, no?). At its core the method is **just** reading native Japanese content while accumulating/reviewing vocabulary with [Anki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software)) each day.

Effective as this method is, it has its issues. First is the considerable friction in actually reading native content. Who has time to find intersting and free content (sorry, newspaper articles) and get it in front of them each day? Second is the pain of looking up new words. Have you ever had to flip through a ËæûÊõ∏ to look up a word? Yuck. Talk about a surefire way to lose the will to learn. Even today with copy, paste, and Google Translate, there is still considerable friction. The final issue is Anki itself. Spaced Repetition may be the most powerful way to brute force acquire knowledge, but creating new cards based off the content you are reading is a painstaking, manual process. Sure, there are pre-made decks out there, but that will only get you so far. Perhaps even more troubling is the UI. Most people expect apps to look and feel polished, both with layout and design,Using the app is not intuitive, the manual is long, and  What is the right amount of cards to learn/review each day? A 

that limits the usefulness of the method. the material I needed in a convenient (read: free) way. It also struck me that Anki and other SRS apps are exceedingly painful to use when you're trying to make  What better way to do that than learn computer science, create a blog, and support an entire ecosystem of similar minded Japanese language enthusiasts? Ok, perhaps I do have a siginficant amount of time to dedicate on hobbies...

**Who is this site for?**

As you might have gathered from above, this site is NOT dedicated to beginners. Sorry, I'm just not that interested in helping beginners learn the ropes of Japanese, and honestly you should thank me for it. I'm not a patient teacher and there are a lot of better and FREE resources out there. Don't be coming around the Nihongo Journey twitter page asking me for support to learn „Å≤„Çâ„Åå„Å™ or „Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä. I'll just point you to Duolingo. Looking to learn some basic Êº¢Â≠ó? Go check out Wanikani. Need to learn the basics of grammar? Tae Kim's got you [covered](http://guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. 

But who are you going to call on the journey to learn 6000 vocabulary words? Or to obtain the mythical 10,000 sentences?
