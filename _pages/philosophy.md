The posts in this section discuss the guiding principles behind the Nihongo Journey framework. Think of these as the mindset underlying the site.

**Note:** If you are familiar with AJATT or Matt vs Japan, this section may be a bit repetitive for you. Much of the underlying philosophy behind the tools this site provides is based on the foundation created by AJATT (upon which Matt vs Japan created his method). However, there are some major differences in my approach, especially with regards to spaced repetition system (SRS) usage and immersion environments (hintâ€”it's not required). Consider reading this [article](AJATT-lite) for a full comparison.
