Reading native Japanse content in Japense is the primary allure for many of us who embark upon a dedicated years-long Japanese study. But like most motivators, this desire to "really" grasp the cultural nuances and the "true" meaning of a Japanese work comes with a darker flip side. This is, of course, the fear that you are not yet good enough to get the true meaning at your skill level. 

It turns out that FOMO based on lack your nascent Japanese ability is or will soon be a major stumbling block on your Nihongo Journey. This is because FOMO blocks you from reading the very thing that got you on this Nihongo Journey in the first place. Remember that アニメ you want to watch but are holding off on because you want do not want to be dependent on the English subs? The FOMO has you. Avoiding the mesmermizing (and shocking still untranslated) works of 貴志 祐介 because you're afraid you will not "get" 新世界より on your first pass? Your hesistancy to take the plunge is preventing you from ever getting there. 

So what's the solution? You guessed it: the easy path. Don't fight the FOMO. Instead, recognize that FOMO holds the key to beginning your swan dive into the native content you've always wanted to read. Go where the FOMO isn't. Go to the familiar. Read what you aleady know.
