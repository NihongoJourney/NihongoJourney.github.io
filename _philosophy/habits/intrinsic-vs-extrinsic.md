Post to discuss: Tim Ferriss approach to language learning. 

Psychology: we underestimate the importance of intrinsic motivation when we take on a job. Same goes for language learning. 

Solutions: don't make it a job, or change the motivation. 

You'll need proper motivation along the way. If Japanese culture and content is not instrinsically interesting to you, it may be quite hard to sustain motivation.
