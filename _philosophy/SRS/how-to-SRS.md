# What is an SRS?

A Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is ~~just a deck of flashcards that shuffles itself~~ the best technology you've never heard of.

Remember reveiwing your notes before a test? That's spaced repetition. Hearing the names of DBZ characters each Saturday morning? Spaced repetition as well. 

# The Optimal Algorithm 

It's easy to get wowed by algorithm's underlying an SRS and how they can improve retention (over 80%? 90%?!!). There is a tendency to think that the goal with an SRS is to strive for optimality in the retention algorithm. The problem is that optimizing for retention likely will lead to violating the One and Only Law. This is because SRS reviews are inherently boring. And the more optimal the algo becomes for retention, the more frequently it shows you cards before you would likely forget them. 

Unless you are a robot, reviewing cards that are not challenging will lead to boredom, which will lead to lack of enjoyment, which will lead to dropping a knee, and before you know it, you have submitted to death on your Nihongo Journey. In fact, even the creater of the original algo, ___ had to mod

Not about zero-sum win or lose. It's about showing up (great article by Khatz here). 


Not about binging or fear: you should not have to worry about the reviews that are piling up.
