Post to discuss: the lost promise of the SRS. Even TinyCards was discontinued on DuoLingo

It's boring. But got to eat your veggies. Make it as painless as possible. 

Long thought: the way to get SRS tech in the hands of the masses - have decks and reviews graded in school.

Almost no one uses it. Fringe cases by us nutso's don't get teh normal public working on it. 

Why am I becoming a mechanical engineer to learn how to drive a car? This should be effortless.
