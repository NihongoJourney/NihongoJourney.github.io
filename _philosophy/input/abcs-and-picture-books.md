Start with the picture books. Best way to learn because its easier to understand (lots of context clues), and its entertaining (fun!).

Creates options going forward - FOMO-less ability to go watch the anime afterwards and start briding listening with audio + Visual + reading (if subs are on) + prior understanding. 
 - also option to "graduate" to word-less books. Find the goosebumps, Harry Potter equivalents.
