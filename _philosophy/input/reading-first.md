# Input >> Output
Wrong Output, Wrong Habits. 

All about feedback here, which is the hallmark of deliberate practice. 

# Reading >> Listening. 
Go for the media that is easiest to touch. If that's audio or vidoe, that's great. But for most of us its our phone. If you need headphones, its one more thing you have to remember. 

Caveat Emptor: if you subscribe to the 10,000 hours philosophy for listening, make sure you don't exclusively listen to music/songs for 10,000 hours. I tried the 10,000 hours rule for a different language, and did not have much to show after listening to 10,000 hours of music in a foreign lanuage. Stick to podcasts, the news, or TV and let me know how that goes. FWIW, I'm one of those people who can *never* remember lyrics to songs I listen to, even in my native language. So maybe it's a me thing ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

For those of you looking for a podcast to use on your commute, I can recommend japanesepod101.com. For more on listening resources, click here. 

Much easier to avoid listening, as its not a default, when it becomees work. If you plan or already are using audio sources, I recommend limiting your Anki cards to the written materials.
